# CS50 Final Project

Studytogether is a web app that connects students who want to study together.


The site is viewable and usable on both PC and mobile browsers.



#How to view site

There ~~are 2 ways~~ is one way you can view the site.  One is a local copy and ~~one is a copy hosted on the web.~~

##Viewing a Local Copy

To view a local copy, you need to go to meteor.com and install meteor.  Then, from the
command line, navigate to the westudy folder and run the command `meteor`.  One the
app builds, it should be accessible at http://localhost:3000

##Viewing Online

~~We have deployed the most recent version of this app to the following address:
http://StudyTogether.meteor.com . Using this site, you can see updates happening in the
client in real time as people change things in the database.  However, because of
free hosting, it is possible that it is slow / unavailable.~~

Meteor no longer hosts projects for free, so the project is not viewable wihout downloading a local copy.

Thanks for a great year CS50 ARJUN OUT:)
